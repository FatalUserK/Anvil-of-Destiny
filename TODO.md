- Make powder pouch with certain powders anvilable?
- If so: Make the gunpowder that you can collect anvilable

- Update for new update, add new spells

- Add new items?

- FIX: TTT not crumbling

- Find a way to spawn them more consistently
- When anvil pixel scene gets placed close to another, load a normal pixel scene instead
- Add GUI Icon for wand speedup effect (blessing of the gods) and sparkles?

- IDEA for acceleratium potion: Everytime you shoot the wand it has a small chance to apply the speed up effect to the wielder
- Carry over wand effects like speed up to new wands when 2 wand merge
- "Flasks should be added the same way as everything else. Consistency is important, having flasks be added to the anvil differently isn't intuitive."

- Make sure at least 1 projectile spell gets added ALWAYS
- Secret samophlang recipe?
- Urine on anvil = super enrage
- Copy the collision masks into my mods own files so path doesn't matter
- Make enemies drop souls to use for recipes?
- Put something in anvil rooms to allow it to activate a workshop for modifying spells, a purchase of 500 gold maybe?
