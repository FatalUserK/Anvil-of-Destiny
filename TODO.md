- Find a way to spawn them more consistently
- Add unstable polymorphine and other unstable versions
- FIX wand sprite shoot offsets not working?
- FIX still getting same spells?
- Same spells always get added, check randomseed shit?
- Wand with always cast + normal wand always produces output wand with SAME always cast?

- Add magic_liquid_unstable_teleportation
- Add GUI Icon for wand speedup effect (blessing of the gods) and sparkles?

- Sound stops working
- Add runestones?

- IDEA for accelerat potion: Everytime you shoot the wand it has a small chance to apply the speed up effect to the wielder
- Carry over wand effects like speed up to new wands when 2 wand merge
- Flasks should be added the same way as everything else. Consistency is important, having flasks be added to the anvil differently isn't intuitive.

- When anvil pixel scene gets placed close to another, load a normal pixel scene instead
- FIX: TTT not crumbling
- Change how occurence rates work AGAIN, instead of "1.5 anvils per coalmine" use "0.2 anvils per chunk"
- Does the anvil sound keep playing forever even when not visible anymore?
- Change how 2 tablet buff works so it increases capacity
- Improve loader scenes visually
- Add anvil to sand biome?
- Add anvil to volcano
- Make sure at least 1 projectile spell gets added ALWAYS
-------- Add recipe to change a wand to no shuffle
- secret samophlang recipe?
- Urine on anvil = super enrage
- Copy the collision masks into my mods own files so path doesn't matter
- Add recipes for liquids, which create new effects like: pour oil on anvil, it sucks it up and after a certain amount has been sucked, it starts emitting cosmetic oil particles, and if wand is sacrificed, buff that wand slightly and change the spells on it to oil related spells
- Make enemies drop souls to use for recipes?
- Put something in anvil rooms to allow it to activate a workshop for modifying spells, a purchase of 500 gold maybe?
- Add Freezing Liquid
- Add thunderstone recipe, which adds always cast electricity
