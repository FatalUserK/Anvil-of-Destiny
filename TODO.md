- Make mod configurable
- Change the rooms, make them nicer
- Add more rooms (to other tables) to increase the spawn probabilities
- Indicate what level wands have
- Change the wand level logic?
- Make anvil indestructible by black holes etc
- Fix wand levels: starter and coalmine are NOT level 1, they should be level 0


- Once it exists in the game, maybe use ParticleEmitterComponent::use_rotation_from_entity in anvil.xml
  (On hold since it doesn't rotate now anyway)
