- Change how occurence rates work AGAIN, instead of "1.5 anvils per coalmine" use "0.2 anvils per chunk"
- Does the anvil sound keep playing forever even when not visible anymore?
- Change how 2 tablet buff works so it increases capacity
- Improve loader scenes visually
- Add anvil to sand biome?
- Make sure at least 1 projectile spell gets added ALWAYS
-------- Add recipe to change a wand to no shuffle
- secret samophlang recipe?
- Urine on anvil = super enrage

try:
-- Cursed rock = makes adventure mode possible maybe?
-- LifetimeComponent
-- PixelSceneComponent
-- RotateTowardsComponent
-- TeleportComponent
-- VelocityComponent
-- magic number DEBUG_NO_PAUSE_ON_WINDOW_FOCUS_LOST
-- LoadEntitiesComponent

- Once it exists in the game, maybe use ParticleEmitterComponent::use_rotation_from_entity in anvil.xml
  (On hold since it doesn't rotate now anyway)
