- FIX for 1.0:
- Update wand level calculation function for new wands that have super high recharge but low mana
- Urine potion not doing anything
- Coalmine pixel scene update

- IDEA for accelerat potion: Everytime you shoot the wand it has a small chance to apply the speed up effect to the wielder
- IDEA2: Make it apply the effect on enemy kill with that wand
- Carry over wand effects like speed up to new wands when 2 wand merge
- Add recipe for gunpowder flask
- Add recipe for broken wand?
- Flasks should be added the same way as everything else. Consistency is important, having flasks be added to the anvil differently isn't intuitive.

- When anvil pixel scene gets placed close to another, load a normal pixel scene instead
- FIX: TTT not crumbling
- Change how occurence rates work AGAIN, instead of "1.5 anvils per coalmine" use "0.2 anvils per chunk"
- Does the anvil sound keep playing forever even when not visible anymore?
- Change how 2 tablet buff works so it increases capacity
- Improve loader scenes visually
- Add anvil to sand biome?
- Add anvil to volcano
- Make sure at least 1 projectile spell gets added ALWAYS
-------- Add recipe to change a wand to no shuffle
- secret samophlang recipe?
- Urine on anvil = super enrage
- Copy the collision masks into my mods own files so path doesn't matter
- Add recipes for liquids, which create new effects like: pour oil on anvil, it sucks it up and after a certain amount has been sucked, it starts emitting cosmetic oil particles, and if wand is sacrificed, buff that wand slightly and change the spells on it to oil related spells
- Make enemies drop souls to use for recipes?
- Put something in anvil rooms to allow it to activate a workshop for modifying spells, a purchase of 500 gold maybe?
- Add Freezing Liquid
- Add thunderstone recipe, which adds always cast electricity
