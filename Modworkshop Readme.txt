Adds rooms with an anvil into the default biomes, which lets you forge and improve wands!
They appear randomly in the default biomes (Mines, Coal Pits etc), roughly once per biome, with more in the later ones because the biomes are bigger.

You can throw wands and items by opening your inventory and dragging them out into the gameworld.

In other words, adding one tablet will add a random always cast spell to the resulting wand.
When merging two wands, two of the following stats will randomly get buffed while 1 gets nerfed: Cast delay, Recharge time, Spread.
Potions need to be at least 80% full of the material.
To pour a potion, stand on top of the anvil, take the potion into your hand and press the interact key (usually E).

Each anvil can only be used once, but you can find multiple per run.
If you want to use a tablet it needs to be added before the 2nd wand, because 2 wands is already a valid recipe and will start the forging.

The order in which you sacrifice items doesn't matter.
