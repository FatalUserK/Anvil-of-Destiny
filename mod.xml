	name="Anvil of Destiny"
	description="
Adds a semi-rare room with an anvil to most areas, where you can forge 2 wands into a new one\n
with a level that's 1 higher than the lowest of the two. (e.g.: level 3 + level 5 = level 4)\n
How? [spoilers] Just open your inventory and drag the wands out of the slots to throw them,\n
right unto the anvil... OF DESTINY!"
