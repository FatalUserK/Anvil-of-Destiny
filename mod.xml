	name="Anvil of Destiny"
	description="
Adds a semi-rare room with an anvil to most biomes, where you can improve your wands!\n
Just open your inventory and drag your wands out to throw them onto the anvil.\n
Wand + Wand = New better wand based on the stats of the input wands and spells
Tablet + Wand + Wand = Same as above but with 1 additional random always cast spell\n
Tablet + Tablet + Wand = Get back same wand with improved stats!\n
The order in which you sacrifice items doesn't matter. Have fun!"
