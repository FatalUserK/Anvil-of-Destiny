v1.6.1:
- FIX: Potion input now gets properly disabled once anvil is used up.

v1.6.0:
- CHANGE: The potion effect for worm blood now gives spells instead that drill or penetrate ground.
- CHANGE: The potion effect for worm pheromones now spawns worms randomly and attracts worms while the wand is held.
- Added new potion effects for alchemic precursor, draught of midas and freezing liquid.
- Added new potion effects for Arcane Alchemy potions.

v1.5.0:
- New recipes! You can now sacrifice potions if they are at least 80% full. Not all materials are supported.
  They go in place of a second wand and you can also add a tablet like usual to add a random always cast spell.
  The effect will be different depending on the material used. Most will add spells related to the material and
  buff certain stats while others will add unique effects. Spells will only be added if there's enough space.
- Reworked the code, because of that there might be bugs. Please let me know if you find any so I can fix them.

v1.4.10:
- CHANGE: 2 Tablets buff will turn wand into no-shuffle
- FIX: Vault scene now has acid instead of toxic sludge in the containers
- FIX: Something about the easter egg

v1.4.9:
- FIX: Output wand should now have at least one projectile spell MOST of the time
- Statues will once again get angry when the anvil gets damaged

v1.4.8:
- Add more inter-mod compatibility support

v1.4.7:
- Added support for other mod authors to influence anvil spawn probability
- Removed the anvil damage check again because it triggered even though nothing was damaged...

v1.4.6:

- Added smithing animation!
- When spawning the wand, the appropriate sprite now shows instantly
- Fixed audio incompatibility with other mods
- Improved easter egg slightly
- Output wands should now always have at least 1 spell in them
- Balance tweak: New wand should not get capacity reduced by 2 anymore (was 10% chance before)

v1.4.5:
- FIX: Temporary workaround for the anvil being movable. It's immovable now again, but the check if it's damaged doesn't work, and the statues won't get angry. I'll re-add that later.

v1.4.4:
- Increased mana recharge rate and spell count of generated wands.

v1.4.3:
- FIX: No more crashes because of too many tags, because I removed ALL of them!

v1.4.2:
- FIX: Stats of merged wands were being rounded when they shouldn't, resulting in a speedMultiplier of 0... Oops!
- FIX: Updated for the games Nov 26 Beta Update

v1.4.1:
- Fix a bug that would crash the game (FINALLY) (hopefully that's all of them)
- Lowered the power level of generated wands
- Changed the wand generation algorithm
- Anvil room occurence rates lowered slightly

v1.4.0:
- No more data overwrites!
- Got rid of levels, now buffs are based on stats instead, which should improve inter-mod compatibility and reduce bugs
- The runes are not randomly put together anymore and actually make sense, though can be hard to read
- When the anvil gets too damaged, something bad happens and that anvil will stop working
- Slightly changed altar color
- Added easter egg :)

v1.3.1:
- FIX: Wands in the players inventory should not have their level reset to level 0 on respawn (e.g.: Save&Quit + Resume)
- FIX: Anvil state was never actually saved and restored properly on save&quit... huh, it should now
- FIX: Tablet was sometimes not being recognized

v1.3.0:
- Using two level 6 wands in a recipe will now always add one extra permanently attached spell
- Standing on top of the anvil will now show you the level of the wand currently held in your hand
- Improve detection when tablet or wand is thrown onto anvil
- All wands the anvil spits out will be no-shuffle
- Normal generated wands (2 Wands or 2 Wands + 1 Tablet) will get their stats boosted by 25%, randomly split between the following 5 stats, for instance:
  Mana charge speed + 5%
  Mana max + 2%
  Recharge time - 3%
  Cast delay - 9%
  Spread - 6%
- New recipe: 2 Tablets + 1 Wand:
  Boost that wand by 10% on each stat + 40% randomly split between 5 stats (see above), turn it into no-shuffle and increase slots

v1.2.0:
- Known issue: Starterwands sometimes don't get their wand level applied so they won't work
- Changed how anvil room spawn probabilities are calculated and adjusted them
- Added an alternative anvil room to The Vault and Underground Jungle
- You can now tweak the mod by changing the values in anvil_of_destiny_config.lua
- Anvil was too weak that's why there's one new feature and one change:
-- Created wands always had shuffle, now they're always no-shuffle
-- Can now use tablets to power up anvil and give the created wand a random attached spell, if sacrificing two lvl 6 wands there's also a chance the new one has TWO attached spells!

- Starter wands and the wands in coalmine should now also work, hurray! All hail the mighty Anvil of Destiny!

v1.0.0:
- First release (after 3 failed attempts because I forgot to remove some debug stuff)
