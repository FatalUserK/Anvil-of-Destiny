UNRELEASED:
- No more data overwrites!
- Got rid of levels, now buffs are based on stats instead, which should improve inter-mod compatibility and reduce bugs
- The runes are not randomly put together anymore and actually make sense
- When too many pixels of the anvil get destroyed, something bad happens and that anvil will stop working
- Slightly changed altar color
- Added easter egg :)

v1.3.1:
- FIX: Wands in the players inventory should not have their level reset to level 0 on respawn (e.g.: Save&Quit + Resume)
- FIX: Anvil state was never actually saved and restored properly on save&quit... huh, it should now
- FIX: Tablet was sometimes not being recognized

v1.3.0:
- Using two level 6 wands in a recipe will now always add one extra permanently attached spell
- Standing on top of the anvil will now show you the level of the wand currently held in your hand
- Improve detection when tablet or wand is thrown onto anvil
- All wands the anvil spits out will be no-shuffle
- Normal generated wands (2 Wands or 2 Wands + 1 Tablet) will get their stats boosted by 25%, randomly split between the following 5 stats, for instance:
  Mana charge speed + 5%
  Mana max + 2%
  Recharge time - 3%
  Cast delay - 9%
  Spread - 6%
- New recipe: 2 Tablets + 1 Wand:
  Boost that wand by 10% on each stat + 40% randomly split between 5 stats (see above), turn it into no-shuffle and increase slots

v1.2.0:
- Known issue: Starterwands sometimes don't get their wand level applied so they won't work
- Changed how anvil room spawn probabilities are calculated and adjusted them
- Added an alternative anvil room to The Vault and Underground Jungle
- You can now tweak the mod by changing the values in anvil_of_destiny_config.lua
- Anvil was too weak that's why there's one new feature and one change:
-- Created wands always had shuffle, now they're always no-shuffle
-- Can now use tablets to power up anvil and give the created wand a random attached spell, if sacrificing two lvl 6 wands there's also a chance the new one has TWO attached spells!

v1.1.1:
- FIX: Wands should now be detected correctly
- FIX: No more crashes in dev mode when respawning
- FIX: Now works with Noita+ starter wands

v1.1.0:
- Better compatibility with other mods except for ones that modify coalmine wands
- Starter wands and the wands in coalmine should now also work, hurray! All hail the mighty Anvil of Destiny!

v1.0.0:
- First release (after 3 failed attempts because I forgot to remove some debug stuff)
