UNRELEASED:
- 6 + 6 now always gives 2 permaspells

v1.2.0:
- Known issue: Starterwands sometimes don't get their wand level applied so they won't work
- Changed how anvil room spawn probabilities are calculated and adjusted them
- Added an alternative anvil room to The Vault and Underground Jungle
- You can now tweak the mod by changing the values in anvil_of_destiny_config.lua
- Anvil was too weak that's why there's one new feature and one change:
