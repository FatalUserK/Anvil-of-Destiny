# Anvil of Destiny
A mod for Noita (https://noitagame.com/) which adds a bunch of anvils into the default biomes, which lets you forge and improve wands!

Where can you find these anvils? They appear randomly in the default biomes (Mines, Coal Pits etc), roughly once per biome, with more in the later ones because they are bigger.

Currently only works for default wands (wands added by other mods might not work). You can throw wands and items by opening your inventory and dragging them out into the gameworld. If the anvil doesn't eat up the wand, it's either a not supported wand, you missed the hitbox or there's a bug (oh no).

__Here's a video showing how it works: https://youtu.be/iO5c9LrOjlU__

Here are the current recipes, I'll denote the level of the wand like Wand(2) for a level 2 wand. Starterwands and wands in the Mines are level 0, every floor adds 1 more level, there are some exceptions. Just stand on an anvil with a wand in hand and it will tell you its level!
***
### 🌟 Wand + Wand = New wand 1 level higher than the lowest of the two + 25% buff (split randomly between 5 stats)
For instance:
- Wand(2) + Wand(3) = Wand(3)
- Wand(3) + Wand(6) = Wand(4)
- Wand(5) + Wand(5) = Wand(6)
- Wand(6) + Wand(6) = Wand(6) with 1 guaranteed always cast spell

Level 6 is the highest level you can get.
The resulting wands will also get their stats boosted by 25%, randomly split between the following 5 stats, for instance:
- Mana charge speed + 5%
- Mana max + 2%
- Recharge time - 3%
- Cast delay - 9%
- Spread - 6%
***
### 🌟 Tablet + Wand + Wand = Same rules as above but the new wand will have 1 additional random guaranteed always cast spell
- Tablet + Wand(5) + Wand(5) = Wand(6) + 1 always cast spell
- Tablet + Wand(6) + Wand(6) = Wand(6) + 2 always cast spells
### 🌟 Tablet + Tablet + Wand = Buff every stat of that wand by a guaranteed 10% plus another 50% randomly split between the 5 stats listed above

That's it, have fun forging with the holy 🙏 __Anvil of DESTINY__ 🙏!
